Reflecting on this course, I am amazed by the great learning journey it has been. This course not only introduced me to the technical aspects of p5.js and HTML but also allowed me to explore the creative potential of coding. As I have never had any experience with coding before, it was a little difficult to wrap my head around the basics of HTML and p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. But being able to do a bunch of self-learning, in-class tutorials and activities, the hands-on exercises helped solidify my understanding. Each week, we were encouraged to document our learning process, which was greatly valuable as it allowed me to track my progress, reflect on challenges, and celebrate my findings. Writing these reflections helped me internalize the concepts better and provided a comprehensive record of my journey. It was fascinating to see how my understanding evolved over time, from playing around with basic shapes to creating complex interactive elements. 
The outcome of the course was the creation of my final project: a visually engaging and interactive typography website. Through this project I was able to create a new form of visual communication through creative coding. In addition to the final project, I developed a multi-page website documenting my weekly reflections. This site served as a digital portfolio of my learning journey. The SKO involves a page that is dedicated to a specific week, detailing the concepts learned, challenges faced, and solutions found. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my ability to reflect and learn from my experiences. I enjoyed creating the SKO website as I had the ability to customise it to my liking and add some personality. 
The course has significantly improved my problem-solving abilities, as debugging code and finding creative solutions to design challenges were weekly tasks to overcome. Balancing creativity with functionality was a key aspect of this course, teaching me how to use code as a medium for creative expression. Regular documentation and reflection were crucial for my learning, providing a structured way to review my progress and identify areas for improvement. Engaging with peers and instructors for feedback was immensely beneficial, offering new perspectives and ideas that enriched my projects. Overall, the Codewords course was a rewarding experience that expanded my technical skills and creative thinking. The projects I completed, especially the final interactive website and the multi-page reflection site, are testaments to my growth. This journey has not only made me a better coder but also a more reflective and creative individual. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing my exploration of creative coding.
